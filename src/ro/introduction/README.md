# Introduction

InversifyJS is a lightweight (4KB) inversion of control (IoC) container for TypeScript and JavaScript apps. A IoC container uses a class constructor to identify and inject its dependencies.

InversifyJS has a friendly API and encourage the usage of the best OOP and IoC practices.

## Motivation

JavaScript now supports object oriented (OO) programming with class based inheritance. These features are great but the truth is that they are also dangerous.

We need a good OO design to protect ourselves from these threats. The problem is that OO design is difficult and that is exactly why we created InversifyJS.

InversifyJS is a tool that helps JavaScript developers to write code with a good OO design.

## Philosophy

InversifyJS has been developed with 4 main goals:

-   Allow JavaScript developers to write code that adheres to the SOLID principles.
-   Facilitate and encourage the adherence to the best OOP and IoC practices.
-   Add as little runtime overhead as possible.
-   Provide a state of the art development experience.
