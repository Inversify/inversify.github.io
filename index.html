                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                  InversifyJS is a lightweight (4KB) pico inversion of control (IoC)
                  container for TypeScript and JavaScript apps. A pico IoC container
                  uses a class constructor to identify and inject its dependencies.
                <p>
                </p>
                  InversifyJS is easy to integrate with the majority of existing
                  JavaScript frameworks and encourage the usage of the best OOP
                  and IoC practices.

                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                  JavaScript applications are becoming larger and larger day
                  after day. As a result we are using a lot of our architecture
                  exprience from languages like Java or C# in JavaScript.
                  We are embracing OOP with JavaScript but we are not writting
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a>
                  JavaScript. InversifyJS has been designed to allow JavaScript
                  developers to write code that adheres to the SOLID principles.
                </p>

              <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                  InversifyJS has been developed with 3 main goals:
                </p>
                <p>
                  1. Allow JavaScript developers to write code that adheres to
                  the SOLID principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. Facilitate and encourage the adherance to the best OOP
                  and IoC practices.
                <p>
                <p>3. Add as litle runtime overhead as possible.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>
              You can get the latest release using NPM or Bower.
            </p>
            <pre><code>npm install inversify --save</code></pre>
            <pre><code>bower install inversify --save</code></pre>
            <h3 id="typescript_basics">The Basics (with TypeScript)</h3>
            <p>
              The main goal of InversifyJS is top allow JavaScript developers to
              write code that adheres to the SOLID principles. Many of these
              principles refer to the usage of interfaces. The main reason why
              it is not possible to write native SOLID JavaScript is becase the
              language lacks interfaces. In the other hand, TypeScript features
              interfaces, so, <b>if you are going to use InversifyJS it is
              recommended to work with TypeScript to get the most out of it</b>.

                    Our goal is to write

                      SOLID
                    </a>
                    code. This means that we should
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">
                      "depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions."
                    </a>
                    so we will start by declaring some interfaces (abstractions) and continue
                    declaring some classes which implement them (concretions).
                    We will start by declaring two classes (Foo &amp; Bar) which don't have any dependencies.
                  </p>
                  <div class="row-fluid">
                    <div class="col-md-6">
<pre><code>interface FooInterface {
  log() : void;
}

interface BarInterface {
  log() : void;
}

interface FooBarInterface {
  log() : void;
}
</code></pre>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6">
<pre><code>class Foo implements FooInterface {

                    </div>
                  </div>
          <p>
            Now we are going to declare a class named FooBar, which has two
            dependencies (FooInterface &amp; BarInterface). Note that <b>the
            names of the arguments in its constructor are significant</b>
            because the injector uses these to look up the dependencies.
          </p>
<pre><code>class FooBar implements FooBarInterface {
  public foo : FooInterface;
  public bar : BarInterface;
  public log(){
    console.log("foobar");
  }
  constructor(FooInterface : FooInterface, BarInterface : BarInterface) {
    this.foo = FooInterface;
    this.bar = BarInterface;
  }
}
</code></pre>
                </div>
                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="tsbind">
                  <p>
                    Before we can start resolving and injecting dependencies we
                    need to create an instance of the InversifyJS Kernel class.
                    The Kernel will automatically detect is a class has some
                    dependencies by examining its constructor. Note that
                    <b>the names of the arguments in the class constructor
                    are significant</b> because the injector uses these to look
                    up the dependencies.
                  </p>
<pre><code>// kernel
var kernel = new inversify.Kernel();
</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    In order to resolve a depencency, the kernel needs to be
                    told which implementation type (classes) to associate
                    with each service type (interfaces). We will use type
                    bindigns for this purpose. A type binding (or just a
                    binding) is a <b>mapping between a service type (an
                    interface), and an implementation type (class)</b>.
                  </p>
<pre><code>// bind
kernel.bind(new inversify.TypeBinding&lt;FooInterface&gt;("FooInterface", Foo));
kernel.bind(new inversify.TypeBinding&lt;BarInterface&gt;("BarInterface", Bar));
kernel.bind(new inversify.TypeBinding&lt;FooBarInterface&gt;("FooBarInterface", FooBar));
</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    When we declare a type binding, <b>the TypeScript compiler will
                    check that the implementation type (class) is actually
                    and implementation of the service type (interface)</b> and throw
                    a compilation error if that is not the case.
                  </p>
<pre><code>// Compilation error: Bar does not implement FooInterface
kernel.bind(new inversify.TypeBinding&lt;FooInterface&gt;("FooInterface", Bar));
</code></pre>
</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    We should <b>keep the InversifyJS Kernel instantiation and type bindings
                    centralized in one unique IoC configuration file</b>. This will help us
                    to abstract our application from the IoC configuration.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="tsresolve">
                  <p>
                    After declaring the type bindigns, we can invoke the kernel
                    resolve method to resolve a dependency. We will <b>use a string
                    as the interface identifier</b> (instead of the interface itself)
                    because the TypeScript interfaces are not available at runtime.
                  </p>
<pre><code>var foobar = kernel.resolve&lt;FooBarInterface&gt;("FooBarInterface");</code></pre>
</p>
  If the interface that we are tyring to resolve is bind to a
  class that has some dependencies, InversifyJS will resolve and
  inject them into a new instance via the class constructor.
</p>
<pre><code>// Foo and Bar instances has been injected into a new Foobar instance via its constructor
foobar.foo.log(); // foo
foobar.bar.log(); // bar
foobar.log();     // foobar
</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    Our application dependency tree should have one unique
                    root element, known as the application <b>composition root</b>, which
                    <b>is the only place where we should invoke the resolve method</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Invoking resolve everytime we need to inject something, as if it was a
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern">Service Locator</a>
                    is an anti-pattern. If we are working with an MVC framweork
                    the composition root should be located in the application class,
                    somewhere along the routing logic or in a controller factory class. Please refer to the
                    <a href="#easy_integration">integration examples</a> if you need additional help.

            <p>
              InversifyJS is fully compatible with JavaScript, but, since the JavaScript

                    and continue declaring some classes which implement them (concretions). In TypeScript
                    we can define interfaces but JavaScript lacks them. One of the main design goals of
                    inversifyJS is too add as litle runtime overhead as possible so <b>we will not try

                    significant</b> because the injector uses these to look up the
                    dependencies.
                  </p>
<pre><code>var FooBar = (function () {
  function FooBar(FooInterface, BarInterface) {
    this.foo = FooInterface;
    this.bar = BarInterface;
  }
  FooBar.prototype.log = function () {
    console.log("foobar");
  };
  return FooBar;

                  <p>
                    Before we can start resolving and injecting dependencies we
                    need to create an instance of the InversifyJS Kernel class.
                    The Kernel will automatically detect is a class has some
                    dependencies by examining its constructor. Note that <b>the
                    names of the arguments in the class constructor are
                    significant</b> because the injector uses these to look
                    up the dependencies.
                  </p>
<pre><code>// kernel
var kernel = new inversify.Kernel();
</code></pre>
                <p>
                  In order to resolve a depencency, the kernel needs to be
                  told which implementation type (classes) to associate
                  with each service type (interfaces). We will use type
                  bindigns for this purpose. A type binding (or just a
                  binding) is a <b>mapping between a service type (an
                  interface), and an implementation type (class)</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will <b>use a string as the interface identifier</b> (instead of
                  the interface itself or some sort of interface emulation) because
                  the lack of interfaces in JavaScript. This is the main reason why
                  it is recommended to use TypeScript.
                </p>
<pre><code>// bind
kernel.bind(new inversify.TypeBinding("FooInterface", Foo));
kernel.bind(new inversify.TypeBinding("BarInterface", Bar));
kernel.bind(new inversify.TypeBinding("FooBarInterface", FooBar));
</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    We should <b>keep the InversifyJS Kernel instantiation and type bindings
                    centralized in one unique IoC configuration file</b>. This will help us
                    to abstract our application from the IoC configuration.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="messages">
                  <p>
                    After declaring the type bindigns, we can invoke the kernel resolve
                    method to resolve a dependency. We will use a string as the interface
                    identifier as we have already discussed when we defined the type bindings.
                  </p>
<pre><code>// resolve
var foobar = kernel.resolve("FooBarInterface");</code></pre>
</p>
  If the interface that we are tyring to resolve is bind to a
  class that has some dependencies, InversifyJS will resolve and
  inject them into a new instance via the class constructor.
</p>
<pre><code>// Foo and Bar instances has been injected into a new Foobar instance via its constructor
foobar.foo.log(); // foo
foobar.bar.log(); // foo
foobar.log();     // foobar
</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    Our application dependency tree should have one unique
                    root element, known as the application <b>composition root</b>, which
                    <b>is the only component where we should invoke the resolve method</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Invoking resolve everytime we need to inject something, as if it was a

                    is an anti-pattern. If we are working with an MVC framweork
                    the composition root should be located in the application class,
                    somewhere along the routing logic or in a controller factory class. Please refer to the

              As a result, it is really easy to integrate with existing JavaScript
              frameworks and examples of integration withmany popular frameworks are available

            <h3>Good Practices</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion (DI)</a>
              isn't rocket science. We just need to try to avoid <code>new</code> and
              <code>singleton</code> except when there's a compelling reason to
              use them, such as a utility method that has no external
              dependencies, or a utility class that could not possibly have any
              purpose outside the framework (interop wrappers and dictionary
              keys are common examples of this).
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of the problems with IoC frameworks come up when developers
              are first learning how to use them, and instead of actually
              changing the way they handle dependencies and abstractions to fit
              the IoC model, instead try to manipulate the IoC container to meet
              the expectations of their old coding style, which would often
              involve high coupling and low cohesion.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                  <h4>Use a Composition Root to avoid the Service Locator anti-pattern</h4>
                  <p>
                    Our application dependency tree should have one unique
                    root element (known as the application composition root) which
                    is the only component where we should invoke the resolve method.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Invoking resolve everytime we need to inject something, as if it was a
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern">Service Locator</a>
                    is an anti-pattern. If we are working with an MVC framweork
                    the composition root should be located in the application class,
                    somewhere along the routing logic or in a controller factory class.
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Avoid Constructor over-injection</h4>
                  <p>
                    Constructor over-injection is a violation of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.
                    Too many constructor arguments indicates too many
                    dependencies; too many dependencies indicates that the class
                    is trying to do too much. Usually this error correlates with
                    other code smells, such as unusually long or
                    ambiguous ("manager") class names.
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Avoid the injection of data, as opposed to behaviour</h4>
                  <p>
                    Injection of data, as opposed to behaviour, is a subtype of
                    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_%28computer_science%29">poltergeist</a>
                    anti-pattern, with the 'geist in this case being the
                    container. If a class needs to be aware of the current date
                    and time, you don't inject a <code>DateTime</code>, which is
                    data; instead, you inject an abstraction over the system
                    clock. This is not only correct for DI; it is absolutely
                    essential for testability, so that you can test time-varying
                    functions without needing to actually wait on them.
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Avoid declaring every life cycle as Singleton</h4>
                  <p>
                    Declaring every life cycle as Singleton is, to me, a
                    perfect example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">cargo cult programming</a>
                    and to a lesser degree the colloquially-named
                    "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_cesspool#Pitfalls">object cesspool</a>".
                    I've seen more singleton abuse than I care to remember, and
                    very little of it involves DI.
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Avoid implementation-specific interface types</h4>
                  <p>
                    Another common error is implementation-specific interface types done just to be able to register it in the container. This is in and of itself a violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</a> (just because it's an interface, does not mean it's truly abstract) and often also includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_bloat">interface bloat</a> which violates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle">Interface Segregation Principle</a>.
                    </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Avoid optional dependencies</h4>
                  <p>
                    In other words, there is a constructor that accepts dependency injection, but also <em>another</em> constructor that uses a "default" implementation. This also violates the DIP and tends to lead to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">LSP</a> violations as well, as developers, over time, start making assumptions around the default implementation, and/or start new-ing up instances using the default constructor.
                  </p>
